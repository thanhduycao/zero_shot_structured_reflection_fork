cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: email-inbox-forward-nl. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: email-inbox-forward-nl. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: I want the mail by Romy to be sent to Shayne.
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user clicked on the email sender's name "Romy" to view or interact with the email associated with that sender.
2nd action: The user clicked on the "Forward" button, which is typically used to send the current email to another recipient.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: email-inbox-forward-nl. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Please find the mail by Adelina. Forward it to Krystalle.
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user clicked on the email sender's name "Adelina," which likely opened or highlighted the email associated with that sender. This action is typically done to view the details of the email, such as the subject and body content.
2nd action: The user clicked on the "Forward" button to share the email with someone else.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.

However, your last action did not cause anything to change on the last screen. You probably used the wrong action type. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.
